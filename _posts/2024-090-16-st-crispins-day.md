## St. Crispin’s Day speech from Henry V

King Henry V: And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,For thou art framed of the firm truth of valor.Farewell, kind lord. Fight valiantly today.He is as full of valor as of kindness,Princely in both.Enter the King of England.O, that we now had hereBut one ten thousand of those men in EnglandThat do no work today.What’s he that wishes so?My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin.If we are marked to die, we are enoughTo do our country loss; and if to live,The fewer men, the greater share of honor.God’s will, I pray thee wish not one man more.By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;It yearns me not if men my garments wear;Such outward things dwell not in my desires.But if it be a sin to covet honor,I am the most offending soul alive.No, ’faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.God’s peace, I would not lose so great an honorAs one man more, methinks, would share from me,For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,That he which hath no stomach to this fight,Let him depart. His passport shall be made,And crowns for convoy put into his purse.We would not die in that man’s companyThat fears his fellowship to die with us.This day is called the feast of Crispian.
He that outlives this day and comes safe homeWill stand o’ tiptoe when this day is namedAnd rouse him at the name of Crispian.He that shall see this day, and live old age,Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighborsAnd say “Tomorrow is Saint Crispian.”Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,But he’ll remember with advantagesWhat feats he did that day. Then shall our names,Familiar in his mouth as household words,Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.This story shall the good man teach his son,And Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by,From this day to the ending of the world,But we in it shall be rememberèd—We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;For he today that sheds his blood with meShall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile,This day shall gentle his condition;And gentlemen in England now abedShall think themselves accursed they were not here,And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaksThat fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.
