###  Marcus Aurelius 

## Meditations 

#### BOOK 5 - 1-3

1. At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed,
tell yourself: "I have to go to work—as a human being.
What do I have to complain of, if I'm goin to do what I
was born for—the things I was brought into the world to
do? Or is *this* what I was created for? To huddle under the
blankets and stay warm?"

—But it's nicer here ....

 So you were born to feel "nice"? Instead of doing things
and experiencing them? Don't you see the plants, the birds the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you're not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren't you running to do what our nature demands?

—But we have to sleep sometime ....

 Agreed. But nature set a limit on that-as it did on eating and drinking. And you're over the limit. You've
had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you're still below your quota.
 You don't love yourself enough. Or you'd love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for
your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the
social climber for status? When they're really possessed by what they do, they'd rather stop eating and sleeing than give up practicing their arts.
 Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?

2. To shrug it all off and wipe it clean—every annoyance and distraction—and reach utter stillness.
 Child’s play.

3. If an action or utterance is appropriate, then it’s appropriate for you. Don't be put off by other people's comments and criticism. If it’s right to say or do it, then it’s the right thing for you to do or say.
 The others obey their own lead, follow their own impulses. Don’t be distracted. Keep walking. Follow your own nature, and follow Nature—along the road they share.
