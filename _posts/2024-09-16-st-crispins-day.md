## St. Crispin’s Day speech from Henry V

<div>
King Henry V: What’s he that wishes so?<br>
My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin.<br>
If we are marked to die, we are enough<br>
To do our country loss; and if to live,<br>
The fewer men, the greater share of honor.<br>
God’s will, I pray thee wish not one man more.<br>
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,<br>
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;<br>
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;<br>
Such outward things dwell not in my desires.<br>
But if it be a sin to covet honor,<br>
I am the most offending soul alive.<br>
No, ’faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.<br>
God’s peace, I would not lose so great an honour<br>
As one man more, methinks, would share from me,<br>
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!<br>
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,<br>
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,<br>
Let him depart. His passport shall be made,<br>
And crowns for convoy put into his purse.<br>
We would not die in that man’s company<br>
That fears his fellowship to die with us.<br>
This day is called the feast of Crispian.<br>
He that outlives this day and comes safe home<br>
Will stand o’ tiptoe when this day is named<br>
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.<br>
He that shall see this day, and live old age,<br>
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors<br>
And say “Tomorrow is Saint Crispian.”<br>
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.<br>
Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,<br>
But he’ll remember with advantages<br>
What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,<br>
Familiar in his mouth as household words,<br>
Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,<br>
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,<br>
Be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.<br>
This story shall the good man teach his son,<br>
And Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by,<br>
From this day to the ending of the world,<br>
But we in it shall be remembered—<br>
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;<br>
For he today that sheds his blood with me<br>
Shall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile,<br>
This day shall gentle his condition;<br>
And gentlemen in England now abed<br>
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,<br>
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks<br>
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.<br>
